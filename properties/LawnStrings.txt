[TREE_OF_WISDOM_1]
Thank you for taking care of me! Keep giving me fertilizer and I'll give you some very useful information.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_2]
The Carnivorous Plant and the Nut make a great team together. Normal: They shared an apartment in college.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_3]
If you really listen to everything I say, pay attention: You want to have two columns of Sunflowers. Seriously. 

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_4]
Zombie divers... I hate them. The best way to stop them: Walnuts on Water Lilies.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_5]
Tss! Tss! Type ‘future’ while playing to see zombies... from the future!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_6]
How many Petacerezas does it take to kill a Zombistein? I'll give you a hint: more than one, but less than three... Another hint: two.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_7]
If you're looking for Mushrooms for your Zen Garden, you'll have better luck in night levels.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_8]
I wouldn't worry about damaging the ground with Petasetas: the garden recovers on its own.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_9]
Have you clicked on the flowers in the main menu? Well, do it! I'll wait here for you.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_10]
Legend has it that frozen zombies eat more slowly. And I can confirm that this is a scientific fact.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_11]
Have you heard of the elusive Zombie Yeti? They say it likes to hide in dark places.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_12]
What's cheaper than free? Nothing! That's why Desperate Mushrooms are essential at night!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_13]
Hoping to find aquatic plants for your Zen Garden? I'd bet my phloems you'll have better luck looking in swimming pools.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_14]
Have you noticed that Zombistein sometimes uses OTHER ZOMBIES to crush your plants? Anything to get his loot.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_15]
Stinky the snail loves chocolate. Maybe he loves it a little too much, you know? The thing is, it makes him go crazy... Then he can't stop.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_16]
If you thought that only pool plants appeared in Endless Survival for your Zen Garden, you're wrong: all kinds of plants appear!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_17]
The question shouldn't be “Where can I find chocolate?”, but rather “Where can't I find chocolate?” It can appear in any level!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_18]
Stone Eaters, huh? Only choose them when you see gravestones on the right side with the zombies. That's what I do.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_19]
I've heard that the Caracubo Zombie can withstand 5 times more damage than the common Zombie.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_20]
They say that if you write “moustache,” the undead will undergo a terrible transformation.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_21]
If you shoot with several Ice Creams, will the zombies slow down more? The answer to this dilemma is... “no.”

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_22]
You know that zombies come out of gravestones, right? So why don't you remove them using Stone Eaters in Night Survival? Out of pride?

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_23]
If you want to know how long a level is, count the flags on the bottom bar. It's a foolproof indicator.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_24]
Clean them up. A classic. Everything I tell you is an understatement. The best thing about them? They'll be very useful against jumping zombies.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_25]
If you give a Hypno-Seed to a dancing Zombie, will its extra Zombies also fight for you? Think... The correct answer is ‘yes’.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_26]
Earn money fast by playing Endless Survival! And then give me your bank details...

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_27]
If you think the Plantorch thaws the Icebiter's shots, my friend, let me tell you something: you're a genius.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_28]
Those pesky Vegezombies! What are they thinking, shooting at your plants? They could use a Nut to stop them in their tracks.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_29]
The Bobsled Race and Acrobats mini-games are very, very, very, very difficult. Want to remove a “very”? Then use Flower Stompers.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_30]
Just when you thought Jalapenos had no other uses, the Tree of Wisdom tells you that they also melt ice!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_31]
Once you have acquired the Imitator, click on its silhouette in the upper left corner of the Almanac to see its description.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_32]
The amount of coins you receive at the Bowling Alley is directly proportional to your skill, based on the number of bounces you get per Nut.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_33]
Don't hit the glass! Well, why not? Go ahead, right-click on your Zen Aquarium or Zombiquarium to deafen the zombies.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_34]
When I was still an acorn, my father told me, “My son, Rompejarrones puzzles are easier if you start breaking on the right.”

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_35]
The dancing zombies in Yo, Zombie may seem expensive, but if you place them well, they will pay for themselves.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_36]
I had a very strange dream: cattails popped balloons and zombies fell to the ground. I don't know what it meant.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_37]
Putting aquatic plants in your Zen Garden is mission impossible without a Zen Aquarium. You've been warned.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_38]
Redneck zombies go against their own nature of staying above ground, so use Magneto-mushrooms to disarm them.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_39]
Every day brings new challenges and new opportunities. Oh, and new daisies at Dave's Shop!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_40]
The Mushroom Garden! What's that for? Nothing! Well, except for growing mushrooms, of course.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_41]
Fatigue? Depression? Are your Nutcrackers getting the better of you with ladders? A good Magneto-mushroom and you're good to go.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_42]
The Nutcracker is known for its effectiveness against Jumping Zombies and Dolphin Zombies.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_43]
The explosion of a Cherry Bomb or a Jalapeno is more than enough to knock down a ladder on a Muronuez.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_44]
It's tempting to give all the chocolate to Stinky the snail. It makes him so happy... But remember: Zen plants like it too!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_45]
The Plantorch burns hotter than rage, but Zombictors, doors, ladders, and Zombipults can withstand the heat.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_46]
If you rely on upgraded plants for Infinite Survival, keep in mind that they will be more expensive the more you have in your garden.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_47]
The Little Zombies in Yo, Zombie seem like no big deal. But they're fast and skilled at reaching the last brain when you've finished off all the others.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_48]
If you type ‘trickedout,’ don't be surprised if something happens to your lawnmowers.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_49]
Thanks for taking care of me! I don't know anything new, but I might learn more if you let me grow enough!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_101]
Mmm, I'm craving fertilizer... Yum!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_102]
I think I've seen that cloud before.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_103]
As if I weren't here. I'm staying right here, growing.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_104]
My metabolism is going crazy!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_105]
I'll never understand why animals move around all day long.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_106]
Time passes much more slowly for me than it does for you!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_107]
I think I'm perennial!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_108]
My xylem is itching!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_109]
You can gain a lot of wisdom just by being.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_110]
I've been told that something called “Winter” is coming. I'm not really looking forward to it, to be honest.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_201]
Mmm... Sunlight, how delightful!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_202]
Oops, sorry... I let a little oxygen escape.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_203]
Oh no! I can't grow leaves!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_204]
I think I'm growing!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_205]
At the moment, I lack worldly knowledge!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_301]
I really appreciate all the fertilizer you've given me!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_302]
That cloud looks just like a huge cluster of droplets!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_303]
Do you know my cousin Yggdrasil? He's a huge idol in Sweden.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_304]
I'm doing my sociology degree online. I'm learning so much.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_305]
After much observation, I can confirm that it is the Earth that revolves around the Sun and not the other way around, despite appearances.
[TREE_OF_WISDOM_401]
When you've been in this world as long as I have, you sleep less, but you hallucinate more.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_402]
Why is “separado” written together and “todo junto” written separately?

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_403]
History always repeats itself, but it gets the facts wrong.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_404]
If the past, present, and future coexist at the same time as a temporal unity, surely the ‘now’ is nothing more than a mere illusion.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_405]
Being bold is easy; perseverance, not so much.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_500]
Here is the popular wisdom of bears...

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_600]
Food from the tree!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_800]
Wow! I'm 30 meters tall! Celebrate with me by typing ‘daisies’ to make daisies sprout from the defeated zombies.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_900]
Look at you! I'm already 150 meters tall! That deserves a dance! Type ‘dance’ and the zombies will break into a dance.

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_1000]
YEEEPA! I'm already 300 meters tall! Let's celebrate together by typing ‘pinata’ so the zombies drop candy when they fall!

[TREE_OF_WISDOM_1100]
Thank you for taking care of me! I've taught you everything I know, but I can still grow more!
