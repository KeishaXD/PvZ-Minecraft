# Plants vs Zombies – English Translation Patch

This project is an **English translation patch** for a modded version of Plants vs Zombies.  
The original mod appears to be in **Spanish**, and I (KeishaXD) only translated the in-game texts from **Spanish → English**.  
I **do not own or create** the original mod files.
